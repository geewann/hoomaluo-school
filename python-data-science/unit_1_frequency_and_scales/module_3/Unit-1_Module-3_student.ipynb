Instruments like the piano and keybvoard use a chromatic scale that is made in a slightly different way. Instead of Pythagorean tuning, these instruments use **equal temperament tuning**. In equal temperament tuning, the frequency of each note is always a number $\\alpha$ times the last note $f$. So if $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$ are the first, second, and third notes, then $f_2=\\alpha f_1$, $f_3 = \\alpha f_2 = \\alpha^2 f_1$. "
