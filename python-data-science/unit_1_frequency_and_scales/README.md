# Unit 1: Frequency and Scales

In this unit, we explore the mathematics behind frequencies and scales in music. Your final project for this unit will be to write a tool for musicians that can
* calculate octaves,
* determine frequencies of major and minor scales,
* determine sharps and flats of major and minor scales,
* and more.

The unit is comprised of 3 modules that introduce you to the concepts needed to complete the final project in module 4.
